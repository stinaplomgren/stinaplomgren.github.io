<h1>Week 2: Laser Cutting</h1>
<h2>Laser-Engraved Acrylic Frame</h2>

		  <h2>What I Made</h2>
			I cut a frame out of acrylic and engraved the song that we played at our wedding.
			This picture is what it looked like right after it came out of the printer. It still has a protective sticker that I hadn't peeled off yet.

		  <h2>Plans</h2>
			I designed the frame on the Glowforge website using different sized rectangles.
			I took a screenshot of the Spotify code that is a link to the song on Spotify. If I scan the code on the frame it will play the song automatically.
			This picture is a little hard to see but the design is outlined in light gray. I made it off to the side so I could actually see what I was doing and get the proportions right, but when I went to print it I had to reposition the whole thing.

		  <h2>Materials</h2>
			I cut the frame out of Medium Clear Acrylic. Overall it took somewhere around 35 minutes to cut and engrave.

		  <h2>The Final Product</h2>
			I'm really happy with the way this turned out. It's a little hard to see with the light background but the acrylic was very reflective and I didn't want to turn into a weird "People Taking Pictures of Mirrors" picture.

<h2>GitHub Tutorial:</h2>
	<p>Part of this assignment was to create a GitHub tutorial:
	</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a text editor and write your code. For this tutorial I will be adding a photo to my website.</li>
				<li>In the text editor, add the photo to your local source by writing < img src="Exact name of your photo file here" width="Width Dimension" height="Height Dimension" >, susbstituting the dimensions of your photo.</li>
				<li>Once your code is written, save your file and go to your terminal or command line.</li>
				<li>Type "git status" to see what has been modified and is ready to be sent from the local source to GitHub. Type "git add" and the name of the file that you want to add to GitHub. Type "git status". The files that are ready to be sent will be in green.</li>
				<li>Type "git commit -m" with a message in quotations marks (git commit -m "Added a photo").</li>
				<li>Type "git push" to send your file to GitHub.</li>
				<li>Go to your page on GitHub and refresh it. It will take a few moments for everything to upload and update so try again after a minute or two.</li>
			</ol>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
		  <h3>Website</h3>
		  This was my first attempt at coding a website from scratch.
		  Here are the steps I took:
			<ol>
			  <li>Drew and scanned the cat pictures and plant stand pictures. I also rendered the bracket on TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD was fairly easy to use, though I did have to watch a YouTubue tutorial for how to insert the honeycomb holes in my project because the TinkerCAD tutorial wasn't doing it for me.</li>
			  <li>Coded my homepage. This was the very first code that I wrote, and my husband gave me a little tutorial on how to work GitHub and Sublime Text. I found that I jumped the gun before adding messages when committing, which led to some confusion on my part.</li>
			  <li>I coded the Week 1 page. I got frustrated when it wouldn't push my first picture, and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong before I realized I spelled the file name wrong.</li>
			  <li>I was very very happy when everything worked and showed up on my website.</li>
			</ol>
