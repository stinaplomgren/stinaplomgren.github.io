<h1>Week 3: Printed Circuit Boards</h1>

		  <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
			This was my first time working with any kind of circuit board, printed or otherwise. I took Jennifer's circuit schematic and design and followed it pretty closely, as I knew it would work and I didn't think it would cause me any problems.

		  <h2>Printing</h2>
			I got my board printed pretty quickly, and by Wednesday I started working on it to get rid of any bridged grounds that resulted because of the lack of precision with the printer. It took a while and there was one time that I had to get some fresh eyes on it because I couldn't see what I was missing. By the end of the day on Wednesday all my bridged grounds were taken care of and I soldered my ATtiny85 to the board.

		  <h2>Soldering</h2>
			Soldering went fairly quickly for me. I was able to get all the diodes, LEDs, capacitors, resistors, and the header soldered onto my board in the lab hour on Thursday. Nothing especially dramatic happened, but the little parts were very little and I did have to take some off and wick some solder at various points. Also, I didn't test for bridged grounds along the way, which was pretty bold of me. However, when I did check everything with the multimeter at the end of the day, it all was fine and nothing was in the wrong spot.

			I am excited to have more space and music for my plants.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
		  <h3>Website</h3>
		  This was my first attempt at coding a website from scratch.
		  Here are the steps I took:
			<ol>
			  <li>Drew and scanned the cat pictures and plant stand pictures. I also rendered the bracket on TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD was fairly easy to use, though I did have to watch a YouTubue tutorial for how to insert the honeycomb holes in my project because the TinkerCAD tutorial wasn't doing it for me.</li>
			  <li>Coded my homepage. This was the very first code that I wrote, and my husband gave me a little tutorial on how to work GitHub and Sublime Text. I found that I jumped the gun before adding messages when committing, which led to some confusion on my part.</li>
			  <li>I coded the Week 1 page. I got frustrated when it wouldn't push my first picture, and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong before I realized I spelled the file name wrong.</li>
			  <li>I was very very happy when everything worked and showed up on my website.</li>
			</ol>
