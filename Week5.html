<h1>Week 5: Computer-Controlled Machining</h1>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
			I started with wanting to cut the Chicago skyline, but it's fairly intricate and would take a lot of work and different size bits. Since I wanted to keep the Chicago motif, I landed on the Chicago flag, since it's simple and recognizable. It was fairly easy to find a SVG file of a Chicago flag so I used that and put it into the CNC router via USB.

		  <h2>Cutting</h2>
			The cutting process was harder and more physical than I anticipated. It took effort to cut and engrave everything, but it came out pretty okay. I think it's cool how a knot in the wood lined up perfectly with one of the stars. I sanded down the whole thing to make it smooth and to buff out any stray pieces of wood and it looked a lot better. Maybe in the future when I have a little bit of time I'll put a stain on the wood.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Overall, this week was really easy and low-key for me. I did learn that 3D printing is really easy through BYU since all I have to do was send my design and they take care of the printing.</li>
			  <li>I might print something else in the future, since I see a lot of cool 3D printed designs on the web.</li>
			</ul>

<h2>Sugar Cookie Recipe</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 cups flour, or 480 grams</li>
				<li>1/3 cup corn starch, or 40 grams</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp salt, or 4 grams</li>
				<li>1 cup unsalted butter, or 227 grams</li>
				<li>1 cup sugar, or 200 grams</li>
				<li>2 eggs</li>
				<li>1 tsp vanilla extract, or 5 mL</li>
				<li>Nonpareils, also called hundreds and thousands</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>Sift together the dry ingredients, excluding the nonpareils.</li>
				<li>In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together.</li>
				<li>Add the eggs while mixing. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
				<li>Add vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.</li>
				<li>Pour in the flour mixxture and mix until incorporated.</li>
				<li>Just as everything is coming together, turn off the mixer and add as many nonpariels as you would like. I used half of a 4 ounce jar. Mix these in with a wooden spoon or spatula, and be careful to not overmix.</li>
				<li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator to firm up.</li>
				<li>After at least 30 minutes take dough and roll it out to be about 1/4" thick.</li>
				<li>Cut out cookies in desired shapes, and place on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake at 375F for 12 minutes.</li>
			</ol>
