<h1>Week 5: Computer-Controlled Machining</h1>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
			I started with wanting to cut the Chicago skyline, but it's fairly intricate and would take a lot of work and different size bits. Since I wanted to keep the Chicago motif, I landed on the Chicago flag, since it's simple and recognizable. It was fairly easy to find a SVG file of a Chicago flag so I used that and put it into the CNC router via USB.

		  <h2>Cutting</h2>
			The cutting process was harder and more physical than I anticipated. It took effort to cut and engrave everything, but it came out pretty okay. I think it's cool how a knot in the wood lined up perfectly with one of the stars. I sanded down the whole thing to make it smooth and to buff out any stray pieces of wood and it looked a lot better. Maybe in the future when I have a little bit of time I'll put a stain on the wood.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>This week was also pretty easy for me. The hardest thing for me was the safety quiz about how to use the CNC router and the cutting itself. I did have to deal with the vacuum hose coming off the router itself, but other than that calamity everything turned out well.</li>
			  <li>I might stain this in the future, but I want to preserve that cool knot.</li>
			</ul>
