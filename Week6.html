<h1>Week 6: Casting</h1>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
			I decided that I wanted to cast a ring in bronze after talking to the TA at the metal shop on campus. He said it wouldn't be too hard and that I needed to get a 3D print of the ring that I wanted to make. I designed this ring in TinkerCAD using Codeblocks, as it was much easier to manipulate the Codeblocks into doing what I wanted them to do. I chose the phrase וארשתיך לי לעום from Hosea 2.

			This is where I ran into some trouble. The metal shop is working on some class projects for a metal working class so they were unable to get to my project this week. I'm hoping to have it finished next week.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>This is unrelated to the project but it was insanely hard to get the Hebrew font to type into my text editor. Usually any word processor that I use can change the direction of typing from left to right to right to left when I switch to Hebrew, but my text editor would not do it. I eventually just gave up and write it down backwards.</li>
