<h1>Week 4: 3D Printing</h1>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
			I decided that I wanted to 3D print a cookie cutter in the shape of a 20-sided die. I did a little research to see if PLA was safe for a cookie cutter and the general consensus was that PLA was safe to use for food. I found a design on Thingiverse and uploaded it to Tinkercad. After working on the dimensions a little bit I sent my file to be printed.

		  <h2>Printing</h2>
			Printing wasn't too difficult, though I did run into a problem on Tuesday and Wednesday when the printing lab sent me an email that there was a problem with my design because it had non-manifold edges. They didn't think it would be too big of a problem and because I couldn't really alter the design to solve any of these edges, I went ahead with printing anyway. I picked it up on Thursday and it really was free of issues, which made me happy.

		  <h2>Cookies</h2>
			I tested out my cookie cutter and the cookies turned out really well. I used a recipe for sugar cookies and added cornstarch to make the edges crisp and neat so that they wouldn't spread and I wouldn't lose my design, and I added some multicolor nonpareils (also called hundreds and thousands) to make fun colors.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Overall, this week was really easy and low-key for me. I did learn that 3D printing is really easy through BYU since all I have to do was send my design and they take care of the printing.</li>
			  <li>I might print something else in the future, since I see a lot of cool 3D printed designs on the web.</li>
			</ul>

<h2>Sugar Cookie Recipe</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 cups flour, or 480 grams</li>
				<li>1/3 cup corn starch, or 40 grams</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp salt, or 4 grams</li>
				<li>1 cup unsalted butter, or 227 grams</li>
				<li>2 eggs</li>
				<li>1 tsp vanilla extract, or 5 mL</li>
				<li>Nonpareils, also called hundreds and thousands</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>Sift together the dry ingredients, excluding the nonpareils.</li>
				<li>In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together.</li>
				<li>Add the eggs while mixing. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
				<li>Add vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.</li>
				<li>Pour in the flour mixxture and mix until incorporated.</li>
				<li>Just as everything is coming together, turn off the mixer and add as many nonpariels as you would like. I used half of a 4 ounce jar. Mix these in with a wooden spoon or spatula, and be careful to not overmix.</li>
				<li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator to firm up.</li>
				<li>After at least 30 minutes take dough and roll it out to be about 1/4" thick.</li>
				<li>Cut out cookies in desired shapes, and place on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake at 375F for 12 minutes.</li>
			</ol>
