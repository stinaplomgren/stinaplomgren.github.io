<h1>Week 4: 3D Printing</h1>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
			I decided that I wanted to 3D print a cookie cutter in the shape of a 20-sided die. I did a little research to see if PLA was safe for a cookie cutter and the general consensus was that PLA was safe to use for food. I found a design on Thingiverse and uploaded it to Tinkercad. After working on the dimensions a little bit I sent my file to be printed.

		  <h2>Printing</h2>
			Printing wasn't too difficult, though I did run into a problem on Tuesday and Wednesday when the printing lab sent me an email that there was a problem with my design because it had non-manifold edges. They didn't think it would be too big of a problem and because I couldn't really alter the design to solve any of these edges, I went ahead with printing anyway. I picked it up on Thursday and it really was free of issues, which made me happy.

		  <h2>Cookies</h2>
			I tested out my cookie cutter and the cookies turned out really well. I used a recipe for sugar cookies and added cornstarch to make the edges crisp and neat so that they wouldn't spread and I wouldn't lose my design, and I added some multicolor nonpareils (also called hundreds and thousands) to make fun colors.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>I got very excited on Wednesday and Thursday when things were really working for me, but very frustrated on Friday when things stopped working. I took solace in the fact that everyone else was having trouble as well. I think the most frustrating part was when we had no idea what was going on and we had to make a big guess and assume that the ATtiny85 was broken.</li>
			  <li>I might try to make this work again in the future, but I'll be taking a break for a minute.</li>
			  <li>Even though this was an exercise in patience for me, I did have a good time working on the PCB. It was fun to get it printed and work with something physical, and apply my attention to detail to my soldering job with resistors that were half a centimeter in length and a quarter of a centimeter in width.</li>
			  <li>Overall, it was a learning experience for me and I'm glad that I was able to work with PCBs.</li>
