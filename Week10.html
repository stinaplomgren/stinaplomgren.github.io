<h1>Week 10: Output Devices</h1>

		  <h2>Displaying Text</h2>
			I connected my Arduino to an LCD to send whatever text I wanted to the display. Someone else in class had done an LCD in the weeks prior, and their Arduino and breadboard looked like a jumble of wires so I was intimidated by the project. However, there was an LCD that only required a few connections to the back of the display, so I was psyched to bypass the breadboard and simplify.

		  <h2>Send It</h2>
			This project was really easy. I used the code that someone on an Arduino LCD forum thread recommended and added my own text. Warning: political messaging ahead. I took this picture to send to my sister and it was the only picture that I kept from the trials that I did.
