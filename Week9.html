		  <h2>The Basic Idea</h2>
			This week's assignment was pretty straightforward and seemed easy. We had to connect a sensor of some sort to our Arduino and program it to collect data. I selected a temperature and humidity sensor because I thought it might be helpful for me to monitor the environment for some plants that need higher levels of humitity and heat, like begonias or calatheas.

		  <h2>Programming</h2>
			This is where I ran into some trouble. Either the code that came with the sensor was faulty or something else was going on but I could not get the code to verify and upload to my Arduino. I looked into many solultions on the internet and asked a TA for help. We ended up spending an entire class period troubleshooting the code and eventually just discarded the code that came with the sensor in favor of code that we found on the Arduino website. It ended up working, but then I ran into another problem where the schematic that the sensor came with was incorrect so I had to find another way to wire the sensor to the Arduino. I was super worried that I would fry the sensor or my Arduino but I figured out how to make it work.

		  <h2>Reading Input</h2>
			From there, everything was fairly straightforward. I read the temperature and humidity which were accurate, but I wanted to see how fast it would react, so I put the sensor in a warm and humid spotâ€”my mask. According to the readings, the inside of my mask is pretty warm and humid.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>This was a pretty fun yet challenging week. I had fun setting up the sensor and the Arduino, but became very frustrated when I couldn't get the code to work when it came on so easily for everyone else.</li>
