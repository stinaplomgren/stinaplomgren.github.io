<h1>Week 8: Interface and Application Programming</h1>

		  <h2>The Idea</h2>
			I wanted a way to play a podcast in the morning from my Google Home without getting out of bed or getting on my phone. The Flic allows me to press one button to play my podcast directly from my Google Home.

		  <h2>Programming</h2>
			This took a little more time and thinking than I thought it would take. Getting the Flic set up on my phone wasn't hard, but it doesn't have a way to connect directly with my Google Home. I tried using IFTTT as a middleman between the Flic and the Google Home, but this direction isn't supported on IFTTT either. It was a lot of trial and error. Eventually, I found that I could connect to Spotify directly from the Flic app. I selected my Google Home as the primary playback device and I selected my playlist that containst the podcasts that I want to listen to. It's not the most streamlined or straightforward interface but it gets the job done.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>I did get pretty frustrated when I had tried a thousand different ways to connect the Flic to the Google Home and nothing worked. As far as I can find on the internet, no one has found a way to connect the Flic directly to the Google Home.</li>
			  <li>I'll have to see how seamless the transition between episodes or different podcasts is, and if it will start again in the spot I left off if I switch to a different song or episode on my Spotify.</li>
			</ul>
