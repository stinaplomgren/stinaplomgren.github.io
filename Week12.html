		  <h2>Assembly</h2>
			This was the easiest and most fun part of the project. I assembled the physical structure of the shelf with some wood that I got from Home Depot as well as the brackets that I 3D printed. If you want a close up you can refer to my TinkerCAD design in Week 1. Pretty straightforward.

		  <h2>Programming</h2>
			This part was a bit more complicated. I had figured out how to program the Bluetooth to Raspberry Pi connection back in Week 7, but I wanted to take it a step further. I decided that since I didn't want to connect all the speakers in a network, that I should have the raspberry pi start playing music as soon as I plug it in. I got the inspiration from our Christmas tree: it gives light as soon as I plug it in, and I wanted music as soon as I pluged in the Pi. I coded this, and some code can be found on my repository.

 				<h2>Final Results</h2>
 					Here is my shelf with some grow lights attached to it. It's pretty cool and my plants appreciate the music.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>I was a little surprised with how much time it took to program the Pi. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised given how much time it took me in Week 7, but it did. Again, I think that the final result is really cool and applies a lot of what I learned over the course of the semester: 3D modeling and printing, inputs, outputs, and embedded programming.</li>
