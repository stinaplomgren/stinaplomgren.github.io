		  <h2>Vision</h2>
			Studies show that plants react well to music, and enjoy listening while growing. 
			My idea is to build a plant stand with brackets created either with a 3D printer or a CNC machine
			and run small speakers in to transmit bluetooth audio via a raspberry pi.

		  <h2>Mechanical Modeling</h2>
			I want make a airship captains wheel to control the state of my lab space. 
			It will have a screen that will indicate the mode (e.g. Pary Mode, Demo Mode etc.)

		  <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
			I want make a airship captains wheel to control the state of my lab space. 
			I think I'll use a magnet and hall effect sensors as well as a cool 
			oled display and raspberry pi.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
		  <h3>Website</h3>
		  I tried three strategies for making a website:
			<ul>
			  <li>HTML Picture Links</li>
			  <li>HTML Picture Map to Vanilla HTML pages</li>
			  <li>Wix Page</li>
			  <li>HTML Picture Map to Bootstrap HTML pages (winner)</li>
			</ul>
		  I got frustrated after working with HTML thinking that it was just too plain.
		  However,the Wix route seemed way too confining--I wanted control.
		  Bootstrap allows allows me to start very simple and add complication later
		  if I want it.
		  If I had time I would figure out how to implement a markdown strategy so I 
		  don't have to write so much HTML.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <h3>Version Control</h3>
		  <p>I downloaded and tried Github Desktop for the first time 
		  , I had always used a command line before, and I find I prefer desktop </p>
			I'm still a little fuzzy on pulling, pushing, and merging.
