		  <h2>Wireless Music</h2>
			In preparation for my final project, I wanted to try programming the Raspberry Pi to transmit music to a wireless speaker via Bluetooth.

		  <h2>Programming</h2>
			This project took a little more time to do, as I had to get aquainted with the code and format that the Raspberry Pi runs on. I downloaded an old Tabernacle Choir CD that I had on a flashdrive and added it to the Raspberry Pi, and then took some code for bluetooth that I found. It required a few tweaks but I got it working eventually. In the picture across is a sample of the working code that I used.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>This project was different and took a bit more time than the few previous projects just because of the brand new interface.</li>
			  <li>I took this pretty slow and separated it into a few steps. First I connected the Pi to my headphones and then an aux cord that led to the speaker. I could have stopped there, but since I wanted to prep for my final project I went for the bluetooth Connection..</li>
			</ul>
