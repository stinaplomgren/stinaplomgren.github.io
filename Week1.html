<h1>Week 1: Final Project Idea</h1>
<h2>A Musical Spot for Plants</h2>
<hr>

		  <h2>Vision</h2>
			Studies show that plants react well to music, and enjoy listening while growing. 
			My idea is to build a plant stand with brackets created either with a 3D printer or a CNC machine
			and run small speakers in to transmit bluetooth audio via a raspberry pi.

		  <h2>Plans</h2>
			I will build a two tier shelf for a few plants with a rod to hang some baskets. 
			It will have fabricated brackets with an aesthetically pleasing honeycomb pattern.
			I will wire some speakers through so that I can play my plants' favorite album, "Plantasia."

		  <h2>Some Concerns</h2>
			I'm a little worried about trying to make the raspberry pi work, as I am somewhat new to coding. 
			Affixing the speakers to the raspberry pi might also be difficult, but I might just use an audio jack if I get frustrated.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>
		  <h3>Website</h3>
		  This was my first attempt at coding a website from scratch.
		  Here are the steps I took:
			<ol>
			  <li>Drew and scanned the cat pictures and plant stand pictures. I also rendered the bracket on TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD was fairly easy to use, though I did have to watch a YouTubue tutorial for how to insert the honeycomb holes in my project because the TinkerCAD tutorial wasn't doing it for me.</li>
			  <li>Coded my homepage. This was the very first code that I wrote, and my husband gave me a little tutorial on how to work GitHub and Sublime Text. I found that I jumped the gun before adding messages when committing, which led to some confusion on my part.</li>
			  <li>I coded the Week 1 page. I got frustrated when it wouldn't push my first picture, and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong before I realized I spelled the file name wrong.</li>
			  <li>I was very very happy when everything worked and showed up on my website.</li>
			</ol>
